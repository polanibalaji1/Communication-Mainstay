It is an IOT based project with raspberry pie. 

Main motive of the project is to provide communication to the victims of natural disasters without any signals or any towers. 

As all the towers are collapsed and there will be no signals for the people in that area. 

Here in our project we provide communication to the victims by providing signals though our device without any towers. 

So that by this project victims are able to communicate with the rescue team and the rescue team easily identify the people who are separated from their family.

Rescue team will also be able to know the needs of people there and they can provide them.
